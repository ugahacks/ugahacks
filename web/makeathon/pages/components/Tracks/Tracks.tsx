              Tracks are a certain focus for our hackathon this year that will
              have specific mentor help, workshops, times, and special prizes if
              a project does align with that focus. Our Track this year is{" "}
              <b>Hardware!</b> Builder Byte is excited to see what you will
              build using different forms of hardware technology such as arduino
              kits, raspberry pis, etc! UGAHacks will not be providing any
              hardware materials this year, but you can purchase your own
              materials and your group may be eligible for a reimbursement from
              UGAHacks. More details can be found on page 14 of the pre-event
              guide!
            </p>

              In addition to tracks, some sponsors will even have their own
              challenges geared around a specific theme/tool for hackers to
              participate in.
              <b> There may even be a chance to score some sweet prizes!</b>
